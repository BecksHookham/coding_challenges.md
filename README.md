# Individual technical challenges

**Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well-crafted code?**

By "well-crafted code", we mean code that is:

* Well-tested.
* Easy to read.
* Easy to change.

#### The Purpose of Practice Tech Tests

These tech tests are adapted from real tech tests taken from junior interviews. They are designed to support you to

* grow confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
* develop a structured process that uses TDD and OO design skills to solve complex problems.

#### Tech Test Process

1. Start by reading the [tech test guide](https://github.com/makersacademy/jobhunters/blob/main/pills/tech_test_guide.md).

3. Start working on the [Money Tracker](https://github.com/makersacademy/money_tracker_tech_test/blob/main/README.md) tech test.

4. Work on the tech test until you've completed the features.

5. Review your code and repo.
